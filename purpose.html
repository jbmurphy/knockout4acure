    <h2>Our Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of our organization is to unite communities through the power of basketball to raise funds and awareness for the fight against cancer. Centered around the high-energy and inclusive game of Knockout, our charity hosts team-based tournaments where participants come together not just for competition, but for a cause. By blending the spirit of athleticism with compassionate giving, we aim to create a fun, family-friendly platform that inspires action and supports those affected by cancer.</p>
    <p>Our mission is twofold: to engage people of all ages and skill levels in accessible, team-oriented basketball events, and to channel the enthusiasm generated through these tournaments into meaningful contributions for established cancer research, treatment, and support organizations. Each participating team will raise funds leading up to the event, with 100% of proceeds directly benefiting reputable cancer charities. We believe that small actions—like joining a game of Knockout—can have a big impact when backed by community commitment.</p>
    <p>Through annual events, school partnerships, and corporate sponsorships, we intend to grow this initiative into a nationally recognized movement. We are dedicated to promoting health, unity, and purpose, while honoring those who have battled or are currently battling cancer. By transforming a simple playground game into a symbol of hope and resilience, we strive to make philanthropy active, joyful, and accessible to all.</p>
    <p>This charity is more than a game—it’s a movement where every shot taken is a step toward healing, every team formed is a network of support, and every dollar raised is a contribution to a cancer-free future.</p>
